# Software_Engineering_Project

Roadmap:
Decided to first work on a login system because the project requires having some way of identifying users

Added:
- multiple screens and screen switching
- 'roles' - admin and user
- ability to clear users
- login is linked to database

Needs Changing:
- code from contacts is reused and shows all information - not good for passwords
